JSONPath Parser
===============

JSONPath Parser is a Feeds parser that allows parsing JSON files using the
JSONPath library. It is very similar to the Feeds XPath Parser module.

Documentation for JSONPath can be seen here:
https://github.com/SoftCreatR/JSONPath



Installation
------------

- Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules.

- Setup a Feed and select 'JSONPath parser' as the parser.

Note: This module now bundles the JSONPath library, so installing the xautoload
and libraries module and the libraries module is no longer neecessary.
